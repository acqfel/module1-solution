## Description

The web application presents the user with a text box in which he can list comma-separated items that he usually eats at lunch. After inserting the items, the user must click the "Check If Too Much" button.

If the number of items in the text box is less than or equal to 3, a message appears in the text box that says "Enjoy!". If the number of items is greater than 3 (4, 5, and above), the message "Too much!" appears under the text box.
